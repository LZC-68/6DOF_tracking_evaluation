# 6DOF_tracking_evaluation
Code to visualize and evaluate the dataset from "A Framework for Evaluating 6-DOF Object Trackers" [\[arxiv paper\]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.10075).

The dataset can be downloaded at this [website](http://vision.gel.ulaval.ca/~jflalonde/publications/projects/6dofObjectTracking/index.html).

## Dependencies
To train the network, version 0.1 of [pytorch_toolbox](https://github.com/MathGaron/pytorch_toolbox/tree/v0.1) is required.

## Visualize the dataset

Download the sample dataset [here (583 MB)](http://rachmaninoff.gel.ulaval.ca/static/6dofobjecttracking/sample.tar.gz).
```bash
python visualize_sequence -r /path/to/sample -s interaction_hard -o clock
```

## Evaluating
Evaluating a single sequence : two csv files must be provided, one with ground truth poses and one with the predictions.
Note that each row represent 16 values of a 4x4 transform matrix.
```bash
python evaluate_sequence.py -g /path/to/ground_truth.csv -p /path/to/predictions.csv ```
```

Evaluating a batch of sequence : the following folder structure is needed:
- root
    - modelName
        - object_sequence (ex: dragon_interaction_hard)
            - ground_truth.csv
            - prediction_pose.csv
```bash
python evaluate_batch.py -r /path/to/root ```
```

# Tracker
## Generate the dataset
Change the parameters in [generate_dataset.sh](https://github.com/lvsn/6DOF_tracking_evaluation/blob/master/ulaval_6dof_object_tracking/deeptrack/generate_dataset.sh).
And run to generate the training and validation dataset.

## Train the network
Change the parameters in [train_deeptrack.sh](https://github.com/lvsn/6DOF_tracking_evaluation/blob/master/ulaval_6dof_object_tracking/deeptrack/train_deeptrack.sh).
And run to train the network.
